# Example Scenes

Pre-built SDF scene JSON files for ALICE-SDF Text-to-3D pipeline.

## Few-shot Examples (Hand-crafted)

These scenes are used as few-shot examples in the LLM system prompt:

| File | Description | Nodes | Vertices | Triangles |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| `sphere_on_ground.json` | A simple sphere on a flat ground | 4 | 1,270 | 2,448 |
| `snowman.json` | A snowman (3 spheres, SmoothUnion) | 8 | 422 | 840 |
| `castle_tower.json` | A castle tower with battlements | 11 | 1,030 | 2,244 |
| `alien_mushroom_forest.json` | Alien mushroom forest (RepeatFinite) | 9 | 4,167 | 7,854 |
| `twisted_pillar.json` | A twisted pillar with floating orb | 7 | 510 | 968 |
| `mechanical_gear.json` | A mechanical gear (PolarRepeat) | 9 | 465 | 912 |

## LLM-Generated Scenes (API Test Results)

These scenes were generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash from text prompts:

| Prompt | Nodes | Vertices | Triangles | LLM Time |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| "A medieval castle with towers" | 18 | 2,105 | 4,248 | 49.4s |
| "A robot standing on a platform" | 18 | 750 | 1,184 | 17.5s |
| "An underwater coral reef scene" | 15 | 2,666 | 5,166 | 63.3s |
| "A simple mushroom on grass" | 9 | 8,237 | 16,224 | 6.6s |
| "火山地帯に宇宙船" | 22 | 10,466 | 20,618 | 20.5s |

## Usage

```python
from server.services import sdf_service

# Load and mesh any scene
with open("server/examples/scenes/snowman.json") as f:
    sdf_json = f.read()

data, stats = sdf_service.full_pipeline(sdf_json, resolution=64)
# data = GLB binary, stats = mesh statistics
```

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/mesh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sdf_json": "<contents of any .json file>", "resolution": 64, "format": "glb"}' \
  -o output.glb
```
